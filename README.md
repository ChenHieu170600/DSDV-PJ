//The corona pandemic brings the new normal state to our world, we are all in this together and although Vietnam has gone to the “quarantine phase”, the pandemic is now controlled in our country.
//In many countries in the world, this is still a hot topic and people are definitely very concerned about it.

//We decided to design our project around COVID-19 data for our final project in Data Visualization - a “you get out what you put in” type of project.
